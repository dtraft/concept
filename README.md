# Concept

A simple little tool for developing project Concept Maps.

## Background

The Concept Map is a critical part of the planning process for any project.  It's not as detail oriented as a database diagram, but rather provides a general roadmap of the project's core conceptual models.

This app is designed to make it easy to create and distribute Concept Maps.

## Usage

### Naming a project
Pretty straightforward, just type it into the box in the upper left.

### Concepts 
Get started by created a Concept by entering a name in the upper right hand corner and pressing enter.  This will create the Concept on the canvas.

To move the project around the canvas, just drag the blue header to the desired location.

You can always remove them by hovering over the name of the project and hitting the `X`.

### Fields
Enter the name of a field in the gray box and press enter.  You can change the field type by on the existing field type and selecting a new type.

To create a field which references another concept, just drag the empty box on the right side of the field to another concept.  When the target concept outline in yellow, release the mouse.  You can toggle through different reference types by existing type.  To change the field back to a non-reference type, just click the `X` next the field type.

To rearrange order of fields, click the arrow icon which appear when hovering over the blue concept header.  You can move the fields up and down, and then click the check when you're done.

You can remove a field hoving over the field name and pressing the `X` next to the field name.

### Saving/Loading
Hover over the menu icon in the upper right, you can dowload a project or load from a previously downloaded file.  Also, clicking `Save Project` stores your Concept Map locally.  It can be retrieved by clicking the `Load Project` option next time you visit the tool.

### Zoom
The `+` and `-` icons in the upper right next to the menu icon allow you to zoom in and out.
